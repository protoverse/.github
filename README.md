# protoVERSE

protoVERSE introduces a transformative approach to concurrent design, integrating a Virtual Collaboration Hub and Experience Graph Database to redefine collaborative creativity and efficiency. This innovative project emphasizes the fusion of emotive parameters and spatiotemporal data within design processes, enabling teams to design, engineer, and experience projects simultaneously. By embedding contextual data into design scenarios, it facilitates a dynamic, iterative creative process enriched with continuous, real-time input. The Hub ensures seamless interdisciplinary collaboration, critical for the fast-paced, iterative nature of concurrent design, while the Databases guarantee instant access to vital information for informed decision-making.
